# AspNetCore21CoreUI2
Create new repo for Core.UI demo

Clone of the repository AspNetCore2CoreUI by mvelosop. 
Followed the step by step instructions of article "Building elegant applications with ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1 and CoreUI 2 (Bootstrap 4)". 
Document CoreUI.pdf contains a print out of the article.

Encountered two issues:

1. Unable to create a partial view with a name that contains '-' character.
2. After constructing _Layout according to the instructions given in the article, the layout of Index view seems to
   be broken.
